### Hero Point Train Trails
A collection of trails for the routes I used to use for my Hero Point Trains in HoT and PoF maps. Path of Fire can easily be used to quickly get an elite spec solo (~1-2 hours). It's recommend to bring some friends if you intend to do the Heart of Thorns HP's, as some can be difficult to solo.
