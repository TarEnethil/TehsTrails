# TehsTrails
A collection of xTeh.7146's marker packs. 

Currently contains two packs, World Completion and Teh's Train Trails

World Completion is self-explanatory: It's a pack tailored for speedrunning central tyria map completion. It utilizes all mounts, waypoints and a multitude of markers (Nearing 5,000!) to give you the fastest map completion times possible. The current map comp world record of 11h43m utilizes this packs routing!

Teh's Train Trails are a collection of trails for the routes I used to use for my Hero Point Trains in HoT and PoF maps. Path of Fire can easily be used to quickly get an elite spec solo (~1-2 hours). It's recommend to bring some friends if you intend to do the Heart of Thorns HP's, as some can be difficult to solo. 

Wiki is in the works!
